## 📂 Project Structure


## 🔍 Featured Projects

### Computer Vision Image Filtering
Image filtering application using Canny Edge detection and Seam Carving algorithms implemented in Python. This project demonstrates my understanding of computer vision fundamentals and practical implementation skills.

### Computer Vision 
I have used FlannBasedMatcher for finding the matching points along them and thresholded it using different values and used Homography as well.


### Data Analysis 
A machine learning analysis of COVID-19 vaccination patterns across 20 countries, exploring relationships between economic factors, healthcare infrastructure, and mortality rates while identifying distinct country clusters to inform targeted vaccination strategies.
